## Install

The recommended way to run is via [Docker][docker]. Basic instructions on how
to run without it are also provided.

### Installing with Docker

To use this application with Docker, you can simply pull the prebuilt image:

```zsh
user@local:~$ docker pull ghcr.io/mserajnik/emote-server
```

Alternatively, you can also build the image yourself. The user that is used
inside the container has UID `1000` and GID `1000` by default. You can adjust
this (e.g., to match your host UID/GID) by providing the arguments `USER_ID`
and `GROUP_ID` when making a build.

### Installing without Docker

To install without Docker, you can simply clone the repository and install
dependencies.

```zsh
user@local:~$ git clone https://github.com/mserajnik/emote-server.git
user@local:~$ cd emote-server
user@local:emote-server$ npm i
```

### Dependencies

#### When using Docker

None, besides [Docker][docker] itself.

#### When not using Docker

+ [Node.js][node-js]
+ [GraphicsMagick][graphicsmagick] or [ImageMagick][imagemagick] (set
  `EMOTE_SERVER_USE_IMAGE_MAGICK` accordingly)

This application should work with both the latest LTS and the latest stable
version of Node.js. If you encounter any issues with either of those versions
when not using Docker, please [let me know][issues].

### Updating

This application follows [semantic versioning][semantic-versioning] and any
breaking changes that require additional attention will be released under a new
major version (e.g., `2.0.0`). Minor version updates (e.g., `1.1.0` or `1.2.0`)
are therefore always safe to simply install.

When necessary, this section will be expanded with upgrade guides for new major
versions.

#### Updating with Docker

Simply pull the latest Docker image to update:

```zsh
user@local:~$ docker pull ghcr.io/mserajnik/emote-server
```

#### Updating without Docker

If you chose not to use Docker, you can update via Git:

```zsh
user@local:emote-server$ git pull
user@local:emote-server$ npm i
```

## Usage

### Running with Docker

To make using Docker as easy as possible, a working
[Docker Compose][docker-compose] example setup is provided. To get started with
this example setup, simply duplicate `docker-compose.yml.example` as
`docker-compose.yml` and adjust the variables in the `environment` section as
described [here](#configuration).

Finally, start the containers:

```zsh
user@local:emote-server$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Running without Docker

To run without Docker, you will first need to duplicate the `.env.example` as
`.env` and adjust the variables as described [here](#configuration).

After that, you can start the application:

```zsh
user@local:emote-server$ npm run start
```

### Configuration

Configuration is done entirely via environment variables. Please pay special
attention to the instructions to prevent issues.

+ `EMOTE_SERVER_DEBUG`: prints errors to stderr if set to `true`.
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_USE_IMAGE_MAGICK=false`: instructs the server to use
  ImageMagick instead of GraphicsMagick when set to `true`.
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:8000`: the public URL the server
  will use to display file URLs. __No trailings slashes.__
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_PORT=8000`: the port the server is listening on.
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY=`: an arbitrary string used as access key for the
  server's API. Can be of any (reasonable) length. If left empty, the
  respective routes will be publicly accessible.
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_NUMBER_OF_WORKERS=`: sets the number of workers. By default,
  one worker per logical CPU core is used. You might want to decrease or
  increase that number, depending on your needs/hardware. In general, the more
  workers are running, the more requests can be handled simultaneously. But
  note that increasing the number of workers beyond the number of logical CPUs
  might be detrimental to performance or cause even more serious issues (e.g.,
  crashes).
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_SUPPORTED_FILE_EXTENSIONS=png,gif,apng`: sets the file
  extensions for the files the server should serve. The extensions need to be
  separated with `,`.
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=0`: sets the file size limit in bytes when
  uploading files via the HTTP API. If set to `0`, there is no limit.
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_EMOTES_PATH=./emotes`: the path emotes are served from. Can be
  relative or absolute.
+ `EMOTE_SERVER_FROZEN_EMOTES_PATH=./frozen-emotes`: the path frozen emotes are
  served from. Can be relative or absolute.

### API

#### General

Request and response bodies are always in JSON format (except when uploading
or downloading the actual files). The Authorization header in the format
`Authorization: Bearer <EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY>` or the query parameter
`accessKey=<EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY>` is used to authenticate for all routes
unless `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY` is empty, in which case these routes will be
publicly accessible as well.

The base route (`GET /`) does not require authentication, but can _optionally_
be used to verify access keys. To do this, simply pass an access key as you
normally would, in which case it will either respond normally when using a
valid access key or with an `InvalidAccessKey` error when using an invalid one.

In case of any occuring errors, the response will have the following format and
an appropriate HTTP status code:

```json5
{
  "success": false,
  "error": <error name>
}
```

#### Routes

##### Base

Responds with the version number and the API version number of the
installation. The API version number will increase by 1 every time an existing
API endpoint is modified in a way it behaves differently than before or removed
altogether.

__Route:__ `GET /`

__Response on success:__

```json5
{
  "emoteServer": {
    "version": <version number of the application>,
    "apiVersion": <API version number of the application>
  }
}
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `InvalidAccessKey` (`401`): indicates a missing or wrong access key
  (configured via `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`)

##### Emotes

###### Adding emotes

Adds a new emote. The request has to be of type `multipart-form-data` and the
file needs to have the key `emote`.

__Route:__ `POST /emotes`

__Response on success:__

```json5
{
  "success": true
}
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `InvalidAccessKey` (`401`): indicates a missing or wrong access key
  (configured via `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`)
+ `MissingFile` (`400`): indicates that the file is missing
+ `UnsupportedFileExtension` (`400`): indicates that the file has an
  unsupported file extension (configured via
  `EMOTE_SERVER_SUPPORTED_FILE_EXTENSIONS`)
+ `FileSizeLimitExceeded` (`400`): indicates that the file exceeds the file
  size limit (configured via `EMOTE_SERVER_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT`)
+ `FileExists` (`403`): indicates that a file of the same name already exists
+ `IO` (`500`): indicates an I/O issue (e.g., missing write permissions)

###### Deleting emotes

Deletes the emote with the given filename. If the file does not exist, it will
respond with an error.

__Route:__ `DELETE /emotes/<emote filename>`

__Response on success:__

```json5
{
  "success": true
}
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `InvalidAccessKey` (`401`): indicates a missing or wrong access key
  (configured via `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`)
+ `FileNotFound` (`404`): indicates that the file does not exist
+ `IO` (`500`): indicates an I/O issue (e.g., missing write permissions)

###### Listing emotes

Responds with the list of emotes available to be served.

__Route:__ `GET /emotes`

__Response on success:__

```json5
{
  "success": true,
  "emotes": [
    {
      "name": <name of the emote>,
      "url": <URL of the emote>
    }
    // [â€¦]
  ]
}
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `InvalidAccessKey` (`401`): indicates a missing or wrong access key
  (configured via `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`)
+ `IO` (`500`): indicates an I/O issue (e.g., missing write permissions)

###### Getting emotes

Responds with the requested emote.

__Route:__ `GET /emotes/<emote filename>`

__Output on success:__ The requested emote

__Possible errors:__

+ `InvalidAccessKey` (`401`): indicates a missing or wrong access key
  (configured via `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`)
+ `FileNotFound` (`404`): indicates that the file does not exist

###### Getting frozen emotes

Responds with a "frozen" PNG version (containing the first frame) of the
requested GIF or APNG emote.

__Route:__ `GET /frozen-emotes/<GIF/APNG emote filename>`

__Output on success:__ The requested frozen emote

__Possible errors:__

+ `InvalidAccessKey` (`401`): indicates a missing or wrong access key
  (configured via `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`)
+ `FileNotFound` (`404`): indicates that the file does not exist
+ `IO` (`500`): indicates an I/O issue (e.g., missing write permissions)

###### Deleting frozen emotes

Deletes all frozen emotes (without touching their source emotes). Useful for
forcing regeneration (e.g., after overwriting an emote with another of the same
name).

__Route:__ `DELETE /frozen-emotes`

__Response on success:__

```json5
{
  "success": true
}
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `InvalidAccessKey` (`401`): indicates a missing or wrong access key
  (configured via `EMOTE_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY`)
+ `IO` (`500`): indicates an I/O issue (e.g., missing write permissions)
